            <h2>About the website</h2>
            <p>The website I am designing is a personal website which is implemented as part 
                of the exercise for the course "Internet-Centric Programming" (CS359). 
                The aim of this website is to present a short biography of me, information 
                about my studies, my interests, as well as other personal information that 
                I consider important. The website structure will include various sections such 
                as bio, hobbies, courses I have taken, and social media buttons to connect the 
                visitor to my social media accounts.
            </p>
            <br><hr><br>
            <p>
                This website will be based on the basic principles of HTML5 and CSS3, with the
                aim of creating a properly structured, aesthetically appealing and functional page. 
                In the HTML chapter, special attention will be paid to the use of correct semantic 
                markup, while CSS will be used to format and beautify the page, with an emphasis on 
                adapting it to various devices (responsive design). I will also use tables, lists, images,
                and links to practice my skills in using these HTML tags, as well as Bootstrap
                to improve the look and functionality.
            </p>
            <br><hr><br>
            <p>
                
                The goal of the exercise is not only to create a complete personal website but 
                also to familiarize yourself with the technologies that form the basis of modern web development.
                The website implementation will incorporate all the requirements of the exercise,
                from media playback and social media integration, to using media queries to be fully 
                adaptable to different screens and resolutions.

            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Yannis is 20 years old and studies at the Department of Informatics of the
                University of Crete, which is often called the "Harvard of the Mediterranean" 
                or the "Silicon Valley of Crete". Despite still studying, he's already set his sights
                on getting a job in the IT sector by Christmas, although he hasn't decided exactly what he
                wants to major in yet. His studies in Computer Science give him a broad understanding 
                of the field and he seems to have an interest in various industries, keeping an open 
                mind about his career options.
            </p>
            <br><hr><br>
            <p>John has a relaxed and humorous way of presenting himself, as shown by his willingness
                to share information about himself "like it or not". He shows that he has a positive 
                and carefree attitude, acknowledging that he may not have fully figured out his career
                aspirations yet, but that doesn't worry him too much. He enjoys the process and is open 
                to the challenges that come his way.
